##Description: 
We will be creating an app that provides you with the capability to connect with people in your area through means of social engagement (i.e. messaging, games, etc.). The only way to engage with another person is through the strictly mobile interface, creating simplicity for the user. We will make it easy for you to interact with your friends and make new ones along the way.

##Vision Statement:
We envision a world were interconnectivity is in the palm of your hand. The constantly changing realm of social networks has become an integral part of our lives, and we strive to create the network that interacts with everything and that will move us towards a more connected world.
