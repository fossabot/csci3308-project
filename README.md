##Description: 
We will be creating an app that provides you with the capability to connect with people who attend your university, requiring them to have a @colroado.edu email address to sign up. We will create a user fiendly UI, usable only through mobile devices, creating simplicity for the user. We will make it easy for you to interact with your friends and make new ones along the way.

##Vision Statement:
We envision a world were interconnectivity is in the palm of your hand. The constantly changing realm of social networks has become an integral part of our lives, and we strive to create the network that interacts with everything and that will move us towards a more connected world.

##Motivation:
1.  The social network gives the college students the platform to make friends.
2.	The social network enable the college students to see other people’s life.
3.	Simple way to connect the people from all over the world.
4.	The social network offers a lot entertainment for college students
5.	The social network can keep you out of reality 
6.	The social network offers a lot of knowledges for college students to study.

##Risks:
1.	We will use Android system for this App. So far just one group member is familiar with it. Others of us need study it by ourselves.
2.	We have some experience about this the similar App or website, like Tinder or facebook. But we think that’s not enough. We want to do some better.
3.	We need some special information. For example, we need to collect some social information in the special, just like CU Boulder students information(e.g. email address, daily news and so on)  

##Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk:
1.	We need to study how to use Android system. And we need more group meeting to talk about the problem we meet.
2.	We can talk with our TA, try to look for some more information we can help us.
